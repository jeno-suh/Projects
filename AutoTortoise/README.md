## General info
The app includes several maze-generation algorithms that users can generate mazes to solve with. This project was created to better understand object-oriented programming concepts and design patterns.

## Technologies
Project created with
* Scala 2.12

using Scala Swing for the GUI

## Setup
Clone this repo to your desktop and install [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/).

## Usage
After you clone this repo to your desktop, go to its root directory and run `scala -cp AutoTortoise.jar AutoTortoise`.

## Features
* Eight algorithms to generate mazes with
* Four different maze sizes to choose from
* Free selection of the start and end points of the maze
* Ability to watch the algorithm as it works using a delay

## Inspiration
Project inspired by Mike Spivey's AutoSnail program. The maze-generation algorithms are sourced from [The Buckblog](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/7/maze-generation-algorithm-recap) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm)
